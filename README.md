# fintech-video-booking

A simple landing page for FinTech solutions, with a seamlessly integrated video at the top and a booking function to the bottom of the video. The idea is to attract potential customers by displaying an explainer video and a way to book a meeting for a potential collaboration. Use black, dark blue colors.
